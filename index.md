Hello! You have found Iris' homepage. He is currently in the process of moving to HARBOR (at DESY) in Hamburg, Germany. This introduction will be updated shortly.
{: .welcomefont}

Iris worked most recently as a project scientist in the [Sauter group](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/nicholas-sauter/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) on the [(exa)scale computing for X-ray (f)ree (e)lectron (l)aser diffraction experiments (ExaFEL)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/exafel/) project, bringing our XFEL crystallography data processing tools to the exascale regime. As the world's five instruments capable of these experiments undergo upgrades to enable kHz or MHz image acquisition rates, we are preparing to be able to process these datasets in real time and provide the feedback necessary to drive these experiments. Our code is all open source and is available on github: the [cctbx_project](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project) and [dials](https://github.com/dials/dials) repos make up the core of the codebase, while our scripts and notes for the ExaFEL project are available in the [exafel_project](https://github.com/ExaFEL/exafel_project) repo. Some side projects like the [diffraction simulation viewer](https://github.com/dermen/sim_erice) have their own homes as well.

Outside of the lab, Iris is a coffee afficionado, student of various languages, avid reader, and learner. When he has time he also enjoys electronics, fixing stuff, 3d printing, sewing, aikido, pottery, cooking, baking, bicycling and walking. He is queer/trans/nonbinary and uses pronouns he/him, they/them or she/her.

Iris is reachable at [irisdyoung@gmail.com](mailto:irisdyoung@gmail.com). He is also active on the fediverse via <a rel="me" href="https://neuromatch.social/@iris">mastodon</a> and has some work on up [github](http://github.com/irisdyoung). Publications including associated links and full text pdfs are available on the [publications](https://irisdyoung.github.io/publications/) tab, and should also be associated with his [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4713-9504) record.

_Fact: Iris is 70% coffee by volume._
